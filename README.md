# Persistence-Layer (PL for short)

PL is mutation layer for business entites where you can define a flow to be executed upon every mutation.
The flow can contain enrichments and validations.
PL was designed to be fast for bulk operations and do every SQL operation in bulks, including fetching of all fields required by the flow.

A tutorial link will come soon.

Currently supporting only MySQL.
